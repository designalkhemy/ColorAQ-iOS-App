# ColorGame

A SwiftUI color perception game where players identify the differently colored square in a grid before time runs out.

## About
I wanted to recreate a color game I enjoyed but didn't want to rely on the website version, so I built my own iOS version. Completed in 3-4 days as a fun challenge to practice SwiftUI fundamentals.

## Features
- Progressive difficulty from 2x2 to 9x9 grids
- Decreasing color contrast as levels increase
- Timer-based gameplay

## Tech
Built with SwiftUI using grid layout and timers.

## Future improvements
- Fine-tune color contrast difficulty curve
- Add animations for level transitions
